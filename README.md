# Writing a Compiler in Rust

My sequel to
[Writing an Interpreter in C++](https://github.com/cbebe/monkey-cpp) but with a
sane language this time.

The project is a bytecode compiler and virtual machine for the Monkey
programming language from the book
[Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com).
